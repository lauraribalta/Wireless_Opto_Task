    This class defines how the training protocol is going to be.
    This is, how variables change depending on different conditions (e.g. performance),
    and/or which tasks are going to be run.

    In this class 2 methods need to be implemented:
    - __init__
    - default_training_settings
    - update_training_settings

    In default_training_settings all the variables that can modify the state of 
    the training protocol must be defined.
    In update_training_settings the variables are updated depeding on the
    performance of the animal.
    When a new subject is created, a new row is added to the data/subjects.csv file,
    with these variables and its values.

    The following variables are needed:
    - self.next_task
    - self.refractory_period
    - self.minimum_duration
    - self.maximum_duration
    In addition to these variables, all the necessary variables to modify the state
    of the tasks can be included.

    When a task is run the values of the variables are read from the json file.
    When the task ends, the values of the variables are updated in the json file,
    following the logic in the update method."""

        TASK SETTINGS:Two-Armed Bandit Task (2ABT) – Detailed Description 
        (S4 AND it's variations)
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        This task is a probabilistic two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm designed 
        to assess value-based decision-making and flexibility in mice.
        Mice initiate each trial by poking a center port, which triggers the illumination 
        of both left and right side ports. The animal must choose between these two options,
        but only one port is probabilistically rewarded on each trial. The probability of
        reward associated with each side changes dynamically across blocks of trials, 
        requiring the animal to continuously track and update its internal estimate of which
        side is currently more rewarding.

        Block Structure & Reward Probabilities
        ---------------------------------------
        The session is divided into multiple blocks (e.g., 100), each lasting a variable 
        number of trials. The length of each block is drawn from a uniform distribution.

        Each block is assigned a reward probability for the right port (pR):
        - In "Right" blocks: pR is high (e.g., 0.9), left = 1 - pR.
        - In "Left" blocks: pR is low (e.g., 0.1), meaning the left is more rewarding.

        The sequence of blocks alternates between left- and right-favored, with the option 
        for:
        - Balanced mode: pR for left blocks is always 1 - pR from the paired right block.
        - Independent mode: pR values are randomly assigned, possibly creating imbalances 
        over the session.
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        The following variables are used in S4 tasks, they are defined as follows:
            - N_trials: max number of trials in the session
            - N_blocks: max number of blocks in the session
            - mean_x: mean trial duration in the block  
            - block_type: can be 'fixed' (always mean_x trial in block)
              and 'exp'(exponential distribution with mean_x trials as a mean  )
            - prob_right_values: probability usend in the blocks during the session
              if you want the prob_Right to be ONLY 0.8 and 0.2, 
              then make this list prob_right_values = [0.8]
            - prob_block_type: can be 'rdm_values' or 'permutation_prob_list'
              'rdm_values' means that the prob_Right in Right blocks is randomly selected from the
              prob_right_values list. The prob_Left in Left blocks is 1 - prob_Right
              'permutation_prob_list' means that the prob_Right in Right blocks is selected from the
              prob_right_values list, but the order of the blocks is permuted.
            - prob_Left_Right_blocks: can be 'balanced' meaning that
              the prob_Right in Right blocks is the same as the prob_Left on Left blocls
              It can also be independent meaning that the prob_Right in Right blocks is
              INDEP of the prob_Left in Left blocks.
              This can cause that in some sessions, the overall prob_R over
              the entire session is larger than 0.5
            - lambda_param is the mean of the ITI distribution, (if it's 
              0.5 = 1/5 so 2 seconds)
